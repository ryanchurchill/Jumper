Maybe: Multiple stories



Pickups

Improve SFX

Procedurally generated

Speed increase?

Intro "video" demo

Player animation might be a tad janky, possibly due to how sprite is set up

Fix spring movement

Dispose of objects

Spikes in the ground

Powerup is hacky - can't put session and sound in prefab

Hazards that bounce you back

Powerup that double speed but gives 5 points

Coins and saws moving together

Better falling animation?

Cleanup audio on death

Audio either choppy or lagged


Level Progression:
1- coins only
 - moving coins
2- static coins and saws
 - moving coins and saws
3- more hazards and powerups?
4- randomizing locations
5- gradual speed increase
Saws get bigger?
Ceiling gradually turns into chainsaws?
Gradually add chainsaws to ground?

Collision volumes based on force of collision

DONE
Stabalize points
When bar is full, force jump
Some kind of wall to prevent infinite jumping
Jumping Animation
Volume of jump contingent on force
Prevent jumping while still moving left
Still improvements to make to handling land animation / sound
Change player color while preparing jump

Death
- and flow of game
